# Analysis

A repository containing all code and data used for the project started over the summer at the Przybyl Lab, including all data, plots and code.
The final code should be in the "Comparative Code" folder, the rest of the code is experimental. fpCheck is for LM data, and gRangeAccModel is for LMS models.
